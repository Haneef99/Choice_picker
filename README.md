# Choice Picker

Given choices and their weights, the algorithm randomly chooses a choice taking into consideration the weights of the choices too.

## Overview

This project implements an algorithm for choosing from a list of choices based on their assigned weights. Weighted random selection is a common problem in computer science and is used in various applications such as recommendation systems, game development, and more.

## How It Works

1. **Assign Weights**: Each choice in the list is assigned a weight. The weight represents the probability of that choice being selected.
2. **Random Selection**: The algorithm uses randomness to select a choice from the list, with higher-weighted choices having a higher probability of being selected.
3. **Consideration of Weights**: The weights of the choices are taken into account to ensure that choices with higher weights are more likely to be selected, while still allowing for randomness.
